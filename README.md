# Movie-Recommendation-System
This is the simple recommendation system that will give you top movies.

### Abstract:
A movie recommendation is important in our social life due to its strength in providing enhanced entertainment. Such a system can suggest a set of movies to users based on their interest, or the popularities of the movies. Although, a set of movie recommendation systems have been proposed, most of these either cannot recommend a movie to the existing users efficiently or to a new user by any means. In this paper we propose a movie recommendation system that has the ability to recommend movies to a new user. It mines movie databases to collect all the important information, such as, popularity and attractiveness, required for recommendation. It generates movie swarms not only convenient for movie producer to plan a new movie but also useful for movie recommendation.

## Simple Recommender
The Simple Recommender offers generalized recommnendations to every user based on movie popularity and (sometimes) genre. The basic idea behind this recommender is that movies that are more popular and more critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. This model does not give personalized recommendations based on the user.

The implementation of this model is extremely trivial. All we have to do is sort our movies based on ratings and popularity and display the top movies of our list. As an added step, we can pass in a genre argument to get the top movies of a particular genre.

I use the TMDB Ratings to come up with our Top Movies Chart. I will use IMDB's weighted rating formula to construct my chart. Mathematically, it is represented as follows:

Weighted Rating (WR) =  (vv+m.R)+(mv+m.C) 
where,

v is the number of votes for the movie,
m is the minimum votes required to be listed in the chart,
R is the average rating of the movie,
C is the mean vote across the whole report.
